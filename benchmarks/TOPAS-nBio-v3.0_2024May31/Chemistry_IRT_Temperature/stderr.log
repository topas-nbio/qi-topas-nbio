Note that TOPAS interrupted one or more histories during this session
due to errors reported by Geant4.
The total number of interrupted histories was: 49
For details on each of these errors, see the console log for "G4Exception"
If only a very small proportion of your histories were affected,
you may be able to still use the overall result,
but this is a judgement call you need to make for yourself.
You can set TOPAS to limit the number of messages about interrupted histories by setting
the parameter Ts/InterruptedHistoryMaxReports
You can set TOPAS to exit if it exceeds a given number of interrupted histories by setting
the parmameter Ts/MaxInterruptedHistories
